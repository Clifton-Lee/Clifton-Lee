    "\n",
    "For the sake of this project, I'll pretend to be a data analyst for a company that develops Android and iOS mobile applications. Our apps may be found on Google Play as well as the Apple App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a company, we only develop apps that are free to download and install, and in-app advertising is our main source of revenue. In other words, the number of individuals who see and engage with our apps has an impact on the amount of money we make from each app - the greater the number of users who see and interact with the ads, the better. The goal of this project is to do data analysis in order to help our developers in identifying which kinds of apps are most likely to attract more users in the future."
